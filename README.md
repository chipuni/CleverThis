# mysterycompany

A simple demonstration of a self-modifying program in Clojure.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/chipuni/MysteryCompany.

Then run by

    $ lein run

## Usage

This program demonstrates that Clojure allows self-modification.

Change the function in src/mysterycompany/selfoptimizing.clj named
complex-function to any complex function that takes three boolean
inputs and gives one boolean output.

Then run the program. It will (eventually) output the smallest
Clojure function using just the variables, `and`, `or`, and `not`.
